# Campanion
Java Conversion Program Campanion - This will not convert languages

A Java conversion program that converts Bin, Oct, Hex and Dec input into which output the user chooses.

This idea is to allow the user to input a calculation in any of the 4 languages and the result would be calculated and sent back to the user. However the calculation would also be calculated and displayed to the user in a similar way to writing it down and working it out on paper.

The interface would look and work in the same way as a calculator but would be specific to conversions and calculations.

No login we be used to access the program.

------------------Primary Functionality--------------------
Convert between hexadecimal, decimal, binary and octal.
Implement operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Allow the user the option of showing the workings out or not
Make the project compatible with Android 
Add the ability to print the workings out.
Make the program available to download to desktop from the website.

------------------Tertiary Functionality-------------------
(For binary inputs only)
