Java Conversion Program Campanion

A Java conversion program that can convert anything into anything else within reason and within the limits of conversions

Primary functions will include conversions between binary, hexadecimal, octal, denary
with additional conversions with ternary, senary, quaternary, quinary, septenary
nonary, pentadecimal, tryadecimal, vigesimal, etc.

This should also convert between other units such as weight, length, dates, times, energy
currency, light, frequency, force, speed, Torque, Temperature etc.

The GUI will have a number of tabs at the top for the user to flick through. On each tab there will be two (maybe more) 
inputs where the user inputs both numbers that need to be converted. There will need to be space for the result to be 
displayed as well as the meaning as well as an image? 

There could be an option to show all of the possible results for that tab which would be controlled by selecting
radio buttons which would activate/deactivate one or more of the conversions. 

This will not convert languages
